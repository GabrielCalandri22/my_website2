# Who am I?

## My Background

My name is Gabriel Calandri. I was born on July 22nd 2000 in New York City, NY, USA. My family comes from Italy and Belgium, but I feel **Italian** in my heart. Before I was 1, I left Big Apple for London, where my younger brother was born. When I was 5, ma family moved again to Brussels, where I grew up until I went to college, in Madrid, Spain. I have 3 younger siblings: 2 borthers and 1 sister.
    
## My Studies

At 18 years old, I left Belgium to study a BBA at the IE Business School, in Madrid, Spain. During my bachelor studies, I had the chance to study 1 semester abroad, at the University of Michigan - Ross School of Business, located in Ann Arbor, MI, USA. I had the best time, and enjoyed every minute if it (*Go Blue*). During this university exchange,I uncovered a passion for data analytics, which nourished my desire to pursue the MAM at LBS.

## My Professional Experience

When it comes to working experience, I had the chance to experience several positions, in several companies. In 2019, I worked for 2 months as a strategy Analyst Intern for Baobab Collection, a premium candle manufacturer. I was in charge of contributing to the expansion strategy of the brand in the american market. In 2020, I worked during my summer break for Adneom, a technology consulting company, as a Tech Consultant Intern. My role consisted in analyzing project opportunities and drafting project proposals to prospective clients. In 2021, I was a Business Analyst Intern for Kantar, a research and advisory firm, during 3 months. I led a team of two Analysts to act as client partners to help with their diversification strategy campaign, including performing market research and developing effective cost-reducing models. Finally, in 2022, I interned at Gartner, a technology research and consulting company. I was in charge of delivering technology-related insights to  mid-market C-Level Executives to make timely strategic decisions and align action plans with business objectives to improve returns and capture more market share. 

## My Hobbies

As basic as it may seem, I love sports. On one side, I enjoy traditional sports in my routine including:

- Swimming
- Tennis
- Football
- Boxing

In addition to these, I love even more extreme sports. I have been skiing since I was 3 and snowboarding since I was 12. In 2013, I was introduced to kite surfing, and it became my go-to sport. Since then, my family and I travel the world during our holidays to find the best kiting spots!
