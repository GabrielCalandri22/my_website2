# Download TFL data to temporary file

                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>%

The first one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of
monthly rentals.

```{r Chlng1_bike_by_month}
bike_monthly_avg<-bike%>%
  filter(year %in% c(2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022))%>%
  group_by(year, month)%>%
  summarise(monthly_avg=mean(bikes_hired))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  add_row(year=2022, month="Sep")%>%
  add_row(year=2022, month="Oct")%>%
  add_row(year=2022, month="Nov")%>%
  add_row(year=2022, month="Dec")%>%
  group_by(year, month)%>%
  mutate(date=as.Date(paste("01", month, toString(year), sep="/"), "%d/%b/%Y"))

bike_monthly_avg_across_years<-bike%>%
  filter(year %in% c(2016, 2017, 2018, 2019))%>%
  group_by(month)%>%
  summarise(monthly_avg_across_years=mean(bikes_hired))

bike_monthly_avg <-bike_monthly_avg%>% 
  inner_join(bike_monthly_avg_across_years, by = "month")%>%
  mutate(monthly_avg_across_years=ifelse(year==2022 & (month %in% c("Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")), NA, monthly_avg_across_years))
  
bike_monthly_avg
```

```{r Chlng2_plot1, warning=FALSE}
library(ggbraid)

ggplot(bike_monthly_avg,aes(x=date))+geom_line(aes(y=monthly_avg))+geom_line(aes(y=monthly_avg_across_years), color="blue", size=1)+facet_wrap(~year, scales="free_x", nrow=2) + scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b")+
  geom_braid(aes(ymin=monthly_avg, ymax=monthly_avg_across_years, fill=monthly_avg>monthly_avg_across_years))+theme(legend.position="none")+
  labs(title = "Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue and calculated between 2016-2019", 
       caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store",y="Bike rentals", x = element_blank())
```

This graph looks at percentage changes from the expected level of
weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks
14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).

```{r Chlng1_bike_by_week, warning=FALSE}
bike_weekly_avg<-bike%>%
  mutate(year_corrected=ifelse(month=="Jan"&(week==52|week==53), year-1, ifelse(month=="Dec"&(week==1), year+1, year)))%>%
  filter(year_corrected %in% c(2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022))%>%
  group_by(year_corrected, week)%>%
  summarise(weekly_avg=mean(bikes_hired))%>%
  ungroup()

bike_weekly_avg_across_years<-bike%>%
  mutate(year_corrected=ifelse(month=="Jan"&(week==52|week==53), year-1, ifelse(month=="Dec"&(week==1), year+1, year)))%>%
  filter(year %in% c(2016, 2017, 2018, 2019))%>%
  group_by(week)%>%
  summarise(weekly_avg_across_years=mean(bikes_hired))%>%
  ungroup()

bike_weekly_avg <- bike_weekly_avg %>%
  inner_join(bike_weekly_avg_across_years, by = "week")%>%
mutate(weekly_change=weekly_avg/weekly_avg_across_years-1)

bike_weekly_avg
```

```{r Chlng1_plot1, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(bike_weekly_avg, aes(x=week))+geom_line(aes(y=weekly_change))+facet_wrap(~year_corrected, nrow=2)+scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(13, 26, 39, 53))+theme(legend.position="none")+
  geom_braid(aes(ymin=0, ymax=weekly_change, fill=weekly_change>0))+
  geom_rect(data=bike_weekly_avg, aes(xmin=13, xmax=26, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf), color="transparent", fill="grey20",  alpha=0.005)+ 
  geom_rect(data=bike_weekly_avg, aes(xmin=39, xmax=53, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf), color="transparent", fill="grey20",  alpha=0.005)+geom_rug(mapping = aes(color = weekly_change>0), sides="b")+
  labs(title = "Weekly change in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle = "% change from weekly averages calculated between 2016-2019",

```

I use the mean to calculate expected rentals because according to the law of large numbers the sample mean approaches the expected value of a variable as the sample size grows infinitely large. This property makes the mean superior to median when it comes to calculating expected values.
