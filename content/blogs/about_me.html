<h2>My Studies</h2>
<p>At 18 years old, I left Belgium to study a BBA at the IE Business School, in Madrid, Spain. During my bachelor studies, I had the chance to study 1 semester abroad, at the University of Michigan - Ross School of Business, located in Ann Arbor, MI, USA. I had the best time, and enjoyed every minute if it (<em>Go Blue</em>). During this university exchange,I uncovered a passion for data analytics, which nourished my desire to pursue the MAM at LBS.</p>

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>As basic as it may seem, I love sports. On one side, I enjoy traditional sports in my routine including:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>In addition to these, I love even more extreme sports. I have been skiing since I was 3 and snowboarding since I was 12. In 2013, I was introduced to kite surfing, and it became my go-to sport. Since then, my family and I travel the world during our holidays to find the best kiting spots!</p>
